This means that every Python object is simply a cleverly-disguised C structure, which contains not only its value, but other information as well. For example, when we define an integer in Python, such as x = 10000, x is not just a \"raw\" integer. It's actually a pointer to a compound C structure, which contains several values. Looking through the Python 3.4 source code, we find that the integer (long) type definition effectively looks like this (once the C macros are expanded):\n\nstruct _longobject {\n    long ob_refcnt;\n    PyTypeObject *ob_type;\n    size_t ob_size;\n    long ob_digit[1];\n};\n\nA single integer in Python 3.4 actually contains four pieces:\n\n    ob_refcnt, a reference count that helps Python silently handle memory allocation and deallocation\n    ob_type, which encodes the type of the variable\n    ob_size, which specifies the size of the following data members\n    ob_digit, which contains the actual integer value that we expect the Python variable to represent.\n"
